# FINALIZING LEARNING PORTFOLIO #

1. What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

To keep track of the projects we have done and be able to refer back to it in the future.

2. What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite assignment was Assignment 1 - creating my own portfolio/resume. I enjoyed designing my own site and having it be something I can show off to other people to tell them about myself. However, the most rewarding assignment was assignment 2. It felt cool being able to do something that I've seen other websites do :)

3. How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I have grown quite a bit in understanding the back-end framework of web programming, especially dealing with information between clients and servers. I also learned a little about security, and how to avoid security flaws when creating my own webpage. However, if I'm honest, I'm not sure if I can write code from scratch without googling, so I think I can improve in that aspect.

4. What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned in this course is the interaction between clients and server, that without both, the web would not exist. I have always used the terms download and upload, but never understood what the difference was. However, I learned the download refers to a GET method to the server, and an upload is a POST method to the server. Assignment 2 and 3 best demonstrated my learning of clients and servers, being able to use a server in assignment 2 as a client, and recreating that same server in assignment 3.

5. Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would really like to delve deeper into the front-end framework using Bootstrap or React. It was really rewarding when I completed assignment 2 and 3, but when doing the project, my group struggled with trying to make the webpage look pretty. I think being about to get the webpage working and look nice aesthetically, would be even more rewarding. Also, maybe a little more about asynchronous (that was a pain to deal with).
